        <h2> 1. What is a hologram?<a id="top1"></a></h2>
        <p>According to Wikipedia, it is the creation of three-dimensional images based on the use of light. Now, I ask, have you ever seen a 3D film? It seems that objects appear to pass through when we touch them or when there is a special effect when they are approached, etc. Complementing the above mentioned, this is generated from the <b>interference</b>.</p>       
        <p><b>interference</b> is the superposition of two or more waves that occur at a point when it is hit by several waves at the same time. For a simpler and clearer example, imagine for a moment that it is a rainy day, then as you can see, in some places puddles are generated, and when the rain is intense and we observe the puddle, we will see that they form several circles when the drops collide with the puddle, this is called interference.</p>

        </div>
        
        <p>Back to the subject, in addition to the interference, a laser beam is needed to generate these images. This was made possible by the Hungarian physicist Dennis Gabor. Describing a little how a hologram works, it is when the light reflected by the object on which the hologram is to be made onto a plate, the light beams are mixed and recorded onto a film (a surface), thus obtaining a 3D image.</p>

        <h2>3. What is Hatsune Miku?<a id="top3"></a></h2>
        <p>At this point, we know superficially how a hologram works. But, in this case, it is known that she is a virtual singer who was developed from the VOCALOID software, being one of the most famous virtual idols in Japan and her songs reaching the world. She is known to have performed several songs and has had several performances. For this, I liked a video about the evolution of Hatsune Miku's concerts from 2009 to 2018, and we will see the difference of each of the years in each concert.By the way, <b> <i>why is there always a flat screen at your concerts?</i></b></p>

        <h2>4. Hatsune Miku vs a Hologram.<a id="top4"></a></h2>
        <p>As mentioned in the previous section, the question above, why a flat screen and what does holograms have to do with it? Mainly it is due to the way we see things, which is literally what this article boils down to. The formal definition of a hologram says that lasers must be present for the image to form, which is true. However, we will see that in the actual Hatsune Miku concerts there is no laser explicitly reflecting the real image to the virtual one. That is, the screen is apparently flat, which is not entirely true. In the view of the spectator (i.e. us watching the concert), if someone stands in front of the screen and goes "around" the screen with Hatsune Miku projected, there will be a point where the image of Hatsune Miku will not be seen. <b><i>So why do we see it as if it were a hologram?</i></b></p>

        <h2>5. Conclusions<a id="top5"></a></h2>
        <p>
            The answer to the above question is pretty much as mentioned at the beginning, that it was Hatsune Miku. It's a virtualisation, which means that someone previously marked the steps of Hatsune Miku and also by computer programming the voice and also the movement of the mouth. How is this possible? Practically this is being implemented in the video and film industry. A clear example of this is the band Coldplay (among many others), in their song "Adventure Of A Lifetime". Literally, they were not monkeys, but the animations of each of them playing the guitar, drums, bass and Chris Martin becoming a monkey (I leave a video attached, it is in English).

            In conclusion, Hatsune Miku will continue to be a Vocaloid that the world recognises and also that her songs are a hit, as well as her concerts which can be enjoyed with the accompaniment of musicians.But under the traditional concept that Hatsune Miku is a hologram,But under the traditional concept that Hatsune Miku is a hologram, nBut under the traditional concept that Hatsune Miku is a hologram, she is not a hologram.But under the traditional concept that Hatsune Miku is a hologram, she is not a hologram.
